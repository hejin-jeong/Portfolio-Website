        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          This Wordle Game project was created using Java GUI. Basically, the
          wordle game is a word guessing game with a simple grid interface
          where users guess a word. I worked on this project with a group of 4
          during Software Design and Development course in Spring 2022. Our
          project's theme is fruit, so each guess must be a valid five-letter
          word related to fruit. I was in charge of constructing backend
          logic, especially checking the length of the input, comparing user
          input with the answer, displaying color on the grid depending on the
          user input, accumulating scores, and changing levels.
        </p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User can change the difficulty level. (7 attempts for easy, 6 for
            medium, 5 for hard)
          </li>
          <li>User can use physical keyboard as well as virtual keyboard.</li>
          <li>
            User can mute the music, start a new round, and exit the game.
          </li>
          <li>Keys of the letters not in the answer are disabled.</li>
          <li>
            Hints are provided through the color of the grid. (Green is a
            letter that exists in the correct position. Yellow is a letter
            that exists in the answer but is not in the correct position. Red
            is a letter that doesn't exist in the answer.)
          </li>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        This website was created using HTML/CSS. The purpose of this project is to share useful information and resources that the school provides to students in a more accessible manner. My friend and I thought that there are lots of school resources that we can utilize for our academics, residential life, and career but it's hard to find them since they are scattered across different websites and platforms. Therefore, we decided to build a simple website where those resources are listed with direct links and made them easier to access.
